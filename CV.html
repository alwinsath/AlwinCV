<h2><b>Experience</b></h2>
<p><u>Matalan Canterbury – May 2022 to Present</u></p>
<p>This store was a retail business where I was employed as a sales assistant. At this job, I handled
    cash and merchandise over tills, operated and managed self-service checkouts and general
    store maintenance such as janitorial work and making sure clothing was merchandised
    properly. I also handled delivery and registered stock quickly and efficiently. This job elevated
    my people skills as I helped customers with their queries and sales. I also reinforced my
    communication skills and adaptability by communicating effectively with my co-workers.</p>
    <p><u>Londis Longport – February 2020 to May 2021</u></p>
    <p>This locally owned business helped further reinforce my skills that I obtained from my previous
        job. At this job I was a cashier as well as store maintenance. Similar to my previous job, I
        stacked shelves, cleaned stores and unloaded stock from the weekly deliveries. I also
        completed daily checks on equipment such as the freezers and fridges. I also learned how to
        close the shop and completed the required tasks such as making sure all the money in the tills
        were stocked up and the excess taken away</p>
<p><u>Canterbury Wine Mart – Canterbury August 2019 to May 2020</u></p>
<p>This supermarket store was a locally run business which allowed me to gain valuable
    experience and gave me a huge insight into the world of retail. At this job I was a cashier as well
    as maintaining the store such as regular inventory checks, stacking shelves, handling deliveries,
    engaging with customers, and general store maintenance.</p>
